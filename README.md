# Thank you for considering me!

This is a project I created to try and emulate the chat on Twitch.tv, a livestreaming service which has some very active chats in some channels. I chose this as a project to work on optimization when dealing with thousands of messages being displayed/kept in memory. It also offers some extra features that normal Twitch chat does not offer, such as filtering based on keywords or emotes, increased messages displayed, and display percentage counters based on types of messages sent in a certain timeframe.

Feel free the clone the app and check it out by cloning the application and hitting `yarn start`.
